 About NyARToolkit
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 * NyARToolkit is a class library for Augmented Reality (AR) application 
   based on the ARToolkit 5.2.3.
 * Compatible with J2SE7.0 and above.
 * Composed of basic features of ARToolkit, NyARToolkit's orginal features 
   and framework.
 * Consisting of three modules: an independent "lib" module, 
   an environment-dependent "utils" module, and a "sample" module that 
   can package sample applications.
 * The lib module only work under J2ME API environment.
 * The util module provides controls for camera, 3D system, and helper class 
   for interfacing external modules.
 * The sample module is a collection of AR applications, with a minimal 
   amout of features.

Depending on application and purpose, it's not necessary to install all 
the libraries above. Install only those needed.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Getting Started
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This section provides instruction for installing NyARToolkit development 
tools under Eclipse environment.

 1. Create a new workspace/project in Eclipse.
 2. Import lib, utils, and sample modules (directories) into the workspace/project
 3. Correct the errors found at the imported project. Common errors include 
	inconsistent character codes, or reference misses to external JAR files .
	The error of inconsistent character codes can be resolved by changing
	the project's encoding to UTF-8. For resolving reference misses to 
	external JAR libraries, please refer to the chapter of external library 
	(Where is the chapter?). 
 4. Connect webcam to PC.
 5. Run SimpleLiteMStandard.java within NyARToolkit.sample.jogl, and point 
	the webcam to the marker. If a cube appears, the installation of NyARToolkit
	is done!

 Project Outline
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The outline of the Eclipse project.

 * NyARToolkit
   The main body of NyARToolkit library. Basically it will work as normal 
   as long as J2ME API is provided. There are three source folders,
	1)src contains image processing, and numerical calculation classes.
	2)src.markersystem contains a MarkerSystem that is used to make the
	  manipulation of multiple markers easier.
	3)src.rpf contains classes that together form RealityPlatform system.
	
   There is no external libraries required by this module.
   
 * NyARToolkit.sample.java3d
   Sample application that outputs Java3D formats. There is one sample program.
   It depends on two external libraries, Java3D and JMF.
   
 * NyARToolkit.sample.jogl
   A sample that is packaged with some typical methods from OpenGL. 
	1)src contains sample applications that utilize MarkerSystem. It can 
	  further be grouped by those using OpenGL sketching and those not.
	2)src.old includes sample applications of previous formats.
	3)src.rpf includes sample applications that use RealtyPlatform.
	
   Usually, the samples under src will be enough. There are various kinds 
   of samples under src/sketch folder.
   
 * NyARToolkit.sandbox
   It buries unverified or incomplete programs. There are many bugs so 
   the quality is not assured. The sample programs under the test folder 
   will probably be useful if you are to test RealityPlatform.
   
 * NyARToolkit.utils.j2se
   It contains helper classes and test programs that are dependent on JavaSE.
   Classes in this module enable you to input BufferedImage directly into NyARToolkit.
   
 * NyARToolkit.utils.java3d
   It contains helper classes and test programs that are dependent on Java3D.
   It provides NyARToolkit with the ability to output Java3D format.
   
 * NyARToolkit.utils.jogl
   It contains helper classes and test programs that are dependent on Jogl.
   It provides NyARToolkit with the ability to output Jogl format.
 
 * NyARToolkit.utils.qt
   It contains helper classes and test programs that are dependent on QTJava.
   It supports image capturing function via QuickTime.

 NyARToolkit Performance
----------------------------------------------------------------------

NyARToolkit replaced parts of the processing system of ARToolkit to enhance
processing speed. At algorithm level, the performance of detecting one marker
is four times faster, and it is two times faster when simply comparing speed
to ARToolkit.

When RPF(RealityPlatform, added in 3.0.0) module is used, it will likely 
to further increase speed up to 1.5 times faster.

RPF is still unstable, if you don't hava a specific reason, I recommend you
to use MarkerSystem module.

 FAQ
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 *Q1. I cannot save configuration changes in JMF under Windows 7.
	  =>Run JMFRegistry as an administrator, and you will be able to save
		changes to JMF.
		
 *Q2. I cannot simply replace NyARToolkit versions older than 2.5.3 with
	  the latest version?
	  =>Some method parameters are changed. Refer to sample programs and
		make necessary change to function calls.
	   
 *Q3. What is MarkerSystem?
	  =>MarkerSystem is a framework designed to make the use of 
		multiple markers as easy as possible. Coordinates transformation, 
		image acquisition,..etc can also be done without a pain in the neck
		via MarkerSystem. Moreover, the sketching system is improved with 
		reference to Processing's sketching system. So now coding a 
		NyARToolKit application is much more fun than before!
